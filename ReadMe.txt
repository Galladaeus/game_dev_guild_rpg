**---------------------------**

A RPG made for the Pima Community College Game Developer's Guild. 

Current features include:
- A map to move around in, with two npcs you can talk to
- 2 Quests that you can get from the npc's
- A working turn based combat system
- A working inventory system

CamelCase = Non script objects
Underscore case = in script objects

NOTE: If the build ever gives a heap memory exception one possible fix is to alter the defold .config file of the actual Engine and change Xmx... to something larger e.g. -Xmx2048m
