Jan 4 2018:
+ Managed to seperate most of the functionality of creating quests from the npc script
	+ All quests should be placed in seperate .script 's and added to the game object they belong to
+ Found that my validity check functions in create_quest.lua are non-functioning
+ Started work on refactoring all non-code object names to camelCase
+ Pretty much done changing all spacing to tabs
+ Should start using hashes so I can use go.property() 's 

Jan 5 2018:
+ Fully seperated quests and conversations from npc scripts, now they are created in their own seperate scripts
+ Updated owner sprite
+ Also fixed bird game object and scripts

Jan 6 2018:
+ Refactored Quest Log Gui:
	+ Made it so that Multiple quests can now be listed in the quest list
	+ Each quest has its own button, description, title, npc pic, etc.
+ Started work on making the quest_handler.script more robust and useful
+ Fixed some error messages so now they post where they are being posted from
+ Made it so all images now come from the npc_images.atlas rather than npc images being spread all over
+ ~Added sound but was unable to sync with the large .wav file, need to figure out how to compress or override that

Jan 8 2018:
+ Added quest complete button to completed quests so player can collect reward
+ Made it so quests completed and collected are removed from the quest list
+ Now quests are properly handled when completed in quest_log_gui.gui_script
+ Now clicking on different quests in the quest log gui changes to the other quest description
+--WISHLIST ITEM-- add an archived quests tab to store fully completed and collected quests

Jan 9 2018:
+ Quests will simply leave the quest log once they are completed for now
+ Quest rewards are now sent to the player once the player clicks on the complete quest button in the quest log
+ Removed a few uneccesary pictures
+ Added a message_hub script to the world controller that is meant to handle any messages that need to be sent everytime a new level is loaded 

Jan 10 2018:
+ Changed owner sprite again
+ Made it so the quest list moves up if a quest is completed that is not on the bottom of the list, to avoid gaps in the quest list
+ Added basic inventory system with a health, damage boost, and throwable object and number
+ Inventory can be opened by click on the backpack but can not be closed yet, also items have no meaning yet

Jan 11 2018:
+ Changed camera to be placed directly on player GO, while positioning player is a little wierder, now don't have to add a camera to the player each level
+ Make the base inventory system working, player can use health potions to heal, and dmg boost and throwable are ready to be implemented
+ Added debug buttons f2 and f3, which respectively add 1 of each item to inventory and move player to battle level(No combat system yet)
+ Updated player stats to work with inventory system
+ Pressing 'i' also opens inventory in addition to clicking the backpack, and inventory can be closed by pushing 'i' or clicking the x

Jan 12 2018:
+ Implemented base combat movement system, can be tested by pressing f3, you can move in a roguelike manner
+ Base interaction with other elements also implemented, borders will prevent movement, while enemies will be destroyed
+ Camera had to be attached seperately to battle_player otherwise the player position was off from the sprite, which interefered with ray_casting(which may not be needed)

Jan 15 2018:
+ Implemented basic turn system for combat, player takes turn and can no longer perform actions
	+ Collisions are now handled by raycasting rather than colliding into another object, raycasts check each time the player tries to move
	+ The player changes direction and only moves if the move in the direction they are facing
	+ Running into collision borders does not end turn, running into enemies will attack them
	+ To reset turn, currently need to push f2
+ Started working on what a baseline enemy .go will consist of
+ Added a battleController.go that will handle turns and message passing for battles, need to decide whether to put in main and deactivate when not in use, or put the controller in each battle

Jan 17 2018:
+ Implemented player attack so they attack the enemy whenever they run into it
+ Implemented enemy health and death so they die after they lose all their health points
+ Basic enemy movement in place, need to move movement functions into a shared .lua module since player and enemy movement will be largely similar 
+ Rat kill quest is updated in the back if you have it and kill the rat, still need to add a visual que to the quest log 
+ Their is a bug where you can't move back into the combat level after you have left it so I removed the ability to leave the combat level for now
+ Player now uses raycast detection for movement and attack rather than any collision detection
+ Battle controller has been updated so it can handle multiple enemies in the level and let them each take their turn before switching back to player turn
+ Moved debug f keys to a seperate game object so they don't clutter player scripts

Jan 18 2018:
+ Player and enemy now flash when they take damage as a visual que
+ Added a very basic rat spawner, has no logic other than spawning one rat
+ Moved all battle movement logic into a shared module called battle_functions.lua
+ Battle Controller now more robust, tested for handling at least two enemies
+ Enemy now attacks player when moving into them, but currently only moves left
+ Updated player stats so it will show player taking damage when rat hits them 

Jan 19 2018:
+ Implemented basic ai system where enemies will go straight for player and try to attack them
+ Converted music file to .ogg so it is smaller and their is now a constant background music
+ Changed quest so you only have to kill 3 rats:
	+ New bug -> Since the player inside combat is a different GO than regular player, sending quest rewards doesnt point to the right area, need to either disable accepting quests in dungeons or send to a checked URL
+ Added a few more borders to the test combat level
+ Fixed bug where player could attack many times before their turn ended
+ Added behavior to spawn a rat every three turns in the battle_controller.script

Jan 20 2018:
+ Implemented the farm map, has two different scripts for each tileset
+ Added a new quit button confirmation image
+ Changed spawn behavior so only 3 rats appear in total
+ Added an entrance to the rat cellar to the left of the farm
	+ TODO Still no way to exit from dungeon yet though
	+ TODO Probably should add some sort of indicator to make it an obvious entrance
+ Added a custom render script so I could zoom the camera in and out for debugging purposes
*** The max limit on sprites[tiles] is 16384, so if the map is altered in the future all 3 layers can not each have 100x100 tiles each or it will not work

Jan 22 2018:
+ Added an exit to the north door of the combat dungeon
+ Added an exit_check to give the player a chance to change their mind about leaving combat
+ Added item rewards to the quest system
+ Added 3 health potion reward to the talk to owner quest
+ Added a sprite to the ratSpawner to help with debugging and visual purposes
Addt work:
+ Reduced image sizes of player and owner images and added them to game
+ Added different movement animations and idles, not fully complete
+ Resized a few game objects, still need to resize the owner sprite again
+ Adjusted movement of player to match the isometric map
+ In the battle you now see the cat adjust properly before moving

Jan 23 2018:
+ Resized owner image again, will need to resize again because it is too low res in conversations
+ Added idles for each direction to player
+ Added "attack" animations for each cardinal direction (just the walk loop playing once in whatever direction player attacks)
+ Added inventory cat face, that opens when you hover over it
+ Added inventory background of upper and lower teeth and dark grey background
+ Changed farmhouse interior to new image, had to resize it through script and since it is only one piece, the player walks above it
	+ Would be helpful if it was resized to double and split into walls and floors
