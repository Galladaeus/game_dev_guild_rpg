Jan 4 2018:
+ Managed to seperate most of the functionality of creating quests from the npc script
	+ All quests should be placed in seperate .script 's and added to the game object they belong to
+ Found that my validity check functions in create_quest.lua are non-functioning
+ Started work on refactoring all non-code object names to camelCase
+ Pretty much done changing all spacing to tabs
+ Should start using hashes so I can use go.property() 's 

Jan 5 2018:
+ Fully seperated quests and conversations from npc scripts, now they are created in their own seperate scripts
+ Updated owner sprite
+ Also fixed bird game object and scripts

Jan 6 2018:
+ Refactored Quest Log Gui:
	+ Made it so that Multiple quests can now be listed in the quest list
	+ Each quest has its own button, description, title, npc pic, etc.
+ Started work on making the quest_handler.script more robust and useful
+ Fixed some error messages so now they post where they are being posted from
+ Made it so all images now come from the npc_images.atlas rather than npc images being spread all over
+ ~Added sound but was unable to sync with the large .wav file, need to figure out how to compress or override that

Jan 8 2018:
+ Added quest complete button to completed quests so player can collect reward
+ Made it so quests completed and collected are removed from the quest list
+ Now quests are properly handled when completed in quest_log_gui.gui_script
+ Now clicking on different quests in the quest log gui changes to the other quest description
+--WISHLIST ITEM-- add an archived quests tab to store fully completed and collected quests

Jan 9 2018:
+ Quests will simply leave the quest log once they are completed for now
+ Quest rewards are now sent to the player once the player clicks on the complete quest button in the quest log
+ Removed a few uneccesary pictures
+ Added a message_hub script to the world controller that is meant to handle any messages that need to be sent everytime a new level is loaded 

Jan 10 2018:
+ Changed owner sprite again
+ Made it so the quest list moves up if a quest is completed that is not on the bottom of the list, to avoid gaps in the quest list
+ Added basic inventory system with a health, damage boost, and throwable object and number
+ Inventory can be opened by click on the backpack but can not be closed yet, also items have no meaning yet

Jan 11 2018:
+ Changed camera to be placed directly on player GO, while positioning player is a little wierder, now don't have to add a camera to the player each level
+ Make the base inventory system working, player can use health potions to heal, and dmg boost and throwable are ready to be implemented
+ Added debug buttons f2 and f3, which respectively add 1 of each item to inventory and move player to battle level(No combat system yet)
+ Updated player stats to work with inventory system
+ Pressing 'i' also opens inventory in addition to clicking the backpack, and inventory can be closed by pushing 'i' or clicking the x

Jan 12 2018:
+ Implemented base combat movement system, can be tested by pressing f3, you can move in a roguelike manner
+ Base interaction with other elements also implemented, borders will prevent movement, while enemies will be destroyed
+ Camera had to be attached seperately to battle_player otherwise the player position was off from the sprite, which interefered with ray_casting(which may not be needed)

Jan 15 2018:
+ Implemented basic turn system for combat, player takes turn and can no longer perform actions
	+ Collisions are now handled by raycasting rather than colliding into another object, raycasts check each time the player tries to move
	+ The player changes direction and only moves if the move in the direction they are facing
	+ Running into collision borders does not end turn, running into enemies will attack them
	+ To reset turn, currently need to push f2
+ Started working on what a baseline enemy .go will consist of
+ Added a battleController.go that will handle turns and message passing for battles, need to decide whether to put in main and deactivate when not in use, or put the controller in each battle
