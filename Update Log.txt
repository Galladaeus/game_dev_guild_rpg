+ Managed to seperate most of the functionality of creating quests from the npc script
	+ All quests should be placed in seperate .script 's and added to the game object they belong to
+ Found that my validity check functions in create_quest.lua are non-functioning
+ Started work on refactoring all non-code object names to camelCase
+ Pretty much done changing all spacing to tabs
+ Should start using hashes so I can use go.property() 's 

Jan 5 2018:
+ Fully seperated quests and conversations from npc scripts, now they are created in their own seperate scripts
+ Updated owner sprite
+ Also fixed bird game object and scripts
