Jan 4 2018:
+ Managed to seperate most of the functionality of creating quests from the npc script
	+ All quests should be placed in seperate .script 's and added to the game object they belong to
+ Found that my validity check functions in create_quest.lua are non-functioning
+ Started work on refactoring all non-code object names to camelCase
+ Pretty much done changing all spacing to tabs
+ Should start using hashes so I can use go.property() 's 

Jan 5 2018:
+ Fully seperated quests and conversations from npc scripts, now they are created in their own seperate scripts
+ Updated owner sprite
+ Also fixed bird game object and scripts

Jan 6 2018:
+ Refactored Quest Log Gui:
	+ Made it so that Multiple quests can now be listed in the quest list
	+ Each quest has its own button, description, title, npc pic, etc.
+ Started work on making the quest_handler.script more robust and useful
+ Fixed some error messages so now they post where they are being posted from
+ Made it so all images now come from the npc_images.atlas rather than npc images being spread all over
+ ~Added sound but was unable to sync with the large .wav file, need to figure out how to compress or override that

Jan 8 2018:
+ Added quest complete button to completed quests so player can collect reward
+ Made it so quests completed and collected are removed from the quest list
+ Now quests are properly handled when completed in quest_log_gui.gui_script
+ Now clicking on different quests in the quest log gui changes to the other quest description
+ TODO Tomorrow, add an archived quests tab to store fully completed and collected quests
