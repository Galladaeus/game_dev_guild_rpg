TODO LIST:

TODO Document how all the systems work as well as how i am naming things

	Conversation System:
		PROGRAMMATIC:
TODO make it so that all text appears in main text box, buttons are just for continue, accept/reject quests
TODO Maybe replace self with all conversation table params, then all conversation tables have to be named the same thing but it will make it simpler, easier to copy and paste conversations
TODO npc picture needs to change based on who player is talking to
TODO check_argument_validity() in create_conversation should check type as well

	GUI ELEMENTS:
TODO create graphical ui elements


	Battle System:
TODO Create system, player will move a set distance each press, unless no enemy is on screen, enemy will take turn after player


	Quest System:
TODO figure out quest structure to be passed around
TODO create module for creating quests
TODO system that handles updating quests
TODO Update quest log to add quests to list rather than just change the only one


	World Transfer System:
TODO Figure out how to use triggers to load player into different worlds
	UPDATE: Figured out issue with triggers, now need to work on understanding
	proxy collections and best way to transfer in between locations

	NPC Creation System:
TODO Create a script that automates the creation of a npc with variables that will be commonly passed around,
	i.e. sprite data, npc name, etc. Also can use data to automatically fill in certain information when creating
	conversations/quests
TODO NPC images and creation should be seperate from their levels, to allow certain shared elements, like chat bubbles
