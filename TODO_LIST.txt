TODO LIST:

FINAL TODO Document how all the systems work as well as how i am naming things

	Conversation System:
		PROGRAMMATIC:
TODO make it so that all text appears in main text box, buttons are just for continue, accept/reject quests
TODO Maybe replace self with all conversation table params, then all conversation tables have to be named the same thing but it will make it simpler, easier to copy and paste conversations
---TODO npc picture needs to change based on who player is talking to
TODO check_argument_validity() in create_conversation should check type as well
---TODO Refactor the way it selects images, so it selects from npc_images in the shared npc images pool TODO May want to revert behavior
TODO Completely refactor gui element, base element should not have any transformations applied to it, to prevent the parent inheritance nightmare,
	also needs to look way better, and npc images should be handled better

	Map:
TODO Can add two sprites to the tile that the factory creates and they reference different atlases, this should probably allow all script for map generation to be placed in one script

	GUI ELEMENTS:
TODO create graphical ui elements for at least:
	Inventory background
	Quest Log
	Conversations
	Quit button


	Player:
TODO Add different sprites to different move directions, is their an attack animation and sounds to use?

	
	Menu's:
TODO Implement Save, Load
TODO Maybe options???


	Battle System:
---TODO Create system, player will move a set distance each press, unless no enemy is on screen, enemy will take turn after player
TODO Change rat spawning behavior to spawn only a few


	Quest System:
---TODO figure out quest structure to be passed around
---TODO system that handles updating quests
---TODO Update quest log to add quests to list rather than just change the only one
---TODO Add individual complete stamps for each quest box
TODO Rename "monetary_reward" to something like "gold_reward" IS THIS EVEN NEEDED???
TODO Fix quest_reward sending bug, details in update_log
TODO Make item rewards, i.e. potions, etc.


	World Transfer System:
---TODO re-Figure out how to use triggers to load player into different worlds
	UPDATE: Figured out issue with triggers, now need to work on understanding
	proxy collections and best way to transfer in between locations

	NPC Creation System:
TODO Create a script that automates the creation of a npc with variables that will be commonly passed around,
	i.e. sprite data, npc name, etc. Also can use data to automatically fill in certain information when creating
	conversations/quests
KEY TODO Fix npc_images so that they are not dependent on name, or at least the images shown in conversations are not dependent, right now they have
	weird cross dependencies that will create confusion in the future
TODO NPC images and creation should be seperate from their levels, to allow certain shared elements, like chat bubbles
---TODO NPC needs a boilerplate code to avoid alot of duplication, as mentioned above, also deal with chat bubble popping up,etc.

	MUSIC:
TODO Add music from videos that Genji posted
TODO Attribute music in documentation/manual

	QoL Changes:
TODO Rename some of the game objects in the main collection so their names make more sense
